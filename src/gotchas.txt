Be carful about these things:
    - Setting a more permissive set of permissions on the backing file
    creation.
    - After spawning all the processes, make sure the @main waits for
    the @worker child processses to finish before quiting.
    - Only closing the file descriptor @worker and actually unlink it
    @main process. Before, I was unlinking it in both of the processes.
    - Only close the shared semaphore @worker, and actually destroying
    it in @main file.
    - Remove/delete all remaining files in /dev/shm/* before rexecuting
    the program (not needed, but appreaciated).
    - Do not srand() the random number generator in each random generation
    and when you do it, do not use time since the kernel balancer can launch the
    processes all in one time, use their pid instead.
