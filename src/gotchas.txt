+master: fixed error on backing file setup @worker process.
    
    The issue was fixed by:
    - Setting a more permissive set of permissions on the backing file
    creation.
    - After spawning all the processes, make sure the @main waits for
    the @worker child processses to finish before quiting.
    - Only closing the file descriptor @worker and actually unlink it
    @main process. Before, I was unlinking it in both of the processes.
    - Only close the shared semaphore @worker, and actually destroying
    it in @main file.
    - Remove/delete all remaining files in /dev/shm/* before rexecuting
    the program.
