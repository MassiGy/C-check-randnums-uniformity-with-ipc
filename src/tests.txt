On branch local/test-with-lehmer-prng:

This branch tests the Lehmer Pseudo random Generator Algorithm. This one does not use the same 
entropy as rand(), so the results will be diffrent.


Results:
    where
        WORKERS_COUNT = 6
        GENERATIONS_COUNT = 1000 
        ROUNDS_PER_GENERATION = 1000_000
        ARRAY_LEN = 4096 btyes = 1024 ints
        base = WORKERS_COUNT * GENERATIONS_COUNT * ROUNDS_PER_GENERATION / ARRAY_LEN 
    uniformity status ~ 0.71%
