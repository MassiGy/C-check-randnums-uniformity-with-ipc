on branch local/test-with-urandom-file.

This branch tests the random number generation by reading from 
the /dev/urandom file.

Keep in mind that the /dev/urandom is more suited for our usecase compared to 
/dev/random since this one can block our read calls if the demande of random byte
is higher then the stream of bytes provided by the system at the time.

TL;DR: use /dev/urandom rather then /dev/random since this last one is blocking.


The idea behind using this file is to read to a local variable a slice of the generated
bytes. At the end, we will, as for rand(), check the uniformity of the values scanned 
from that file.


Results: 
    uniformity status ~ 1%
