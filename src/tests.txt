On branch local/test-with-multiplication-with-carry-png:

In this branch we use another PNG that uses the multiplication with carry
principle. You will see that in the results below the outcome of the uniformity
check is the same as the rand() function since this branch also uses the srand
function for seed, and then generate values going from that.

Results:
    where
        WORKERS_COUNT = 6
        GENERATIONS_COUNT = 1000 
        ROUNDS_PER_GENERATION = 1000_000
        ARRAY_LEN = 4096 btyes = 1024 ints
        base = WORKERS_COUNT * GENERATIONS_COUNT * ROUNDS_PER_GENERATION / ARRAY_LEN 
    uniformity status ~ 1% 


Observations: 
* Do not forget to add the utils.c file for the worker program compilation.
