- Comment the code more, reread it.
- Optimize for better performance: 

    example: Do we really need to use the semaphore locking here,
    since all the child process are already out ? (this was fixed!)

    ``C
    // print the shared array;
    printf("\n[");
    sem_wait(global_semaphore);
    for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_LENGTH/sizeof(int); i++) {
        printf("%i ",((int*)shared_array)[i]);
    }
    sem_post(global_semaphore);
    printf("]\n");
    
    also, do you need to use the semaphore before any process 
    was spawned? (this one was fixed!)
